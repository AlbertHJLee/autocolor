# autocolor

This project aims to use machine learning to automatically color line art. The goal is to generate clean colored images that can be used in professional illustrations and animations.

Current algorithms tend to use convolutional layers that add interesting but unwanted textures and features to output images. The outputs of this algorithm should be clean images with solid colors that can be incorporated directly into an animation workflow, i.e. something like an automatic paint bucket tool.

G'Mic currently accomplishes this extremely well with human input, but it has yet to be automated.

The long term future goal is to have the algorithm be content-aware so that the same character across multiple frames can be colored automatically.

This project is still in the early stages of development. Please see devlog.txt for details.
