The goal of this project is to automate base coloring in illustrations and animations.

We need a set of training data to teach our network how to autocolor black and white line art.
Ripping frames from professional animation clips gives us a lot of output images.
To generate input images we must extract line art from fully colored frames.

Problem: 
Line extraction should be robust for a wide range of animation styles.
Edge detection is not good for this because it is senstive to features that aren't line art.

Possible solution:
Use a combination of filters to extract the lines, of which edge detection might be one element.
Most animations color in lines that are *originally black*
We may be able to take advantage of this by using a kernel sensitive to sharp gradients towards the color black.
